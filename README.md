Establishing communication connections between data libraries using FDO rules
After generating our SSH keys, we installed the necessary Remote SSH package in Visual Studio Code. We established a server connection through the Add Host section. We needed to install FastAPI for the API, so we started downloading FastAPI and Uvicorn. 
Thus, we successfully installed FastAPI and Uvicorn. 
After researching how to use FastAPI and reviewing examples, we created our first API example. In our example, we were able to obtain a URL and update it each time. Furthermore, we created the data library needed for our project. 
We downloaded and uploaded our CSV file. This data library contains the July temperature values for Germany between 2010 and 2025. We added the necessary libraries to connect to the server. We solved the problem we encountered in the photo by entering a "public key" during the server connection process.
